Input  : n = 3
Output : 4
Explanation:
{1}, {2}, {3} : all single
{1}, {2, 3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single.
{1, 2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single.
{1, 3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single.
Note that {1, 2} and {2, 1} are considered same.
Recursive Algo
f(n) = ways n people can remain single 
       or pair up.

For n-th person there are two choices:
1) n-th person remains single, so only 1 way so  we recur 
   for remaining i.e f(n - 1)   or you can say 1*f(n-1)
2) n-th person pairs up with any of the 
   remaining n - 1 persons. So apart from the 2 people forming a pair for remaining n-2 persons we We get (n - 1) * f(n - 2) ways

Therefore we can recursively write f(n) as:
f(n) = f(n - 1) + (n - 1) * f(n - 2)
